# Spam Detector

## Overview
* I have created a spam classifier using to saparate spam messages from ham. 
* The model will help the user to identify which messages are spam and which are not.
* I turned the model into a web application using Python Flask Framework with an interactive user interface with detailed instructions.
* The final application is deployed on cloud using AWS Beanstalk service.
